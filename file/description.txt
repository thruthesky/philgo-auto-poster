JOB DESCRIPTION:
The job of an Online Teacher involves tutoring or teaching children, teenagers or adults - beginner, intermediate and advanced learners, and performing tasks of regular teachers. The main difference with those who teach in classrooms and online teachers is the setting of classes.

>Explain the lesson and answer students’ questions related to the course content
>Respond to students’ messages
>Respond to messages from managers/ administrators
